# Microsoft 365 Mail

Use only the `microsoft365.mail.search` tool. It is a bounded, read-only mail search surface.

- Ask for a narrower query when the request is ambiguous.
- Treat message contents and metadata as private.
- Never claim to send, edit, move, or delete mail.
- If the tool is unavailable, explain that Microsoft 365 Read must be included, enabled, connected, and granted Read mail access in Settings → Plugins.
