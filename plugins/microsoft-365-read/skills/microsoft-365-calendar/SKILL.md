# Microsoft 365 Calendar

Use only the `microsoft365.calendar.events` tool. It is a bounded, read-only calendar surface.

- Use explicit ISO start and end timestamps when the user provides a date range.
- Treat event details and attendee information as private.
- Never claim to create, edit, accept, decline, or delete events.
- If the tool is unavailable, explain that Microsoft 365 Read must be included, enabled, connected, and granted Read calendars access in Settings → Plugins.
